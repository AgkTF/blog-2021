## Partials

- _Partial_ files do **not** get compiled into CSS files.
- They're used with `@use` rule.

## Modules

- Helps splitting your Sass across multiple files.
- Use a file as a _module_ in another (loading it) by using the `@use` rule.
- Since this file is considered "a module" ðŸ˜‰, you can access its variable, functions and mixins using something like dot notations for objects, as follows.

```scss
@use "colors";

.inverse {
Â  background-color: colors.$primary-color;
}
```

- The compiled output of the loaded files (using `@use` rule) will be included in the output.

## Mixins

- What is the problem?
  You have a group of CSS declarations that you want to reuse across your app.
  Then **mixins** are the way to go.
  ```scss
  @mixin corner-icon($name, $top-or-bottom, $left-or-right) {
    .icon-#{$name} {
      background-image: url('/icons/#{$name}.svg');
      position: absolute;
      #{$top-or-bottom}: 0;
      #{$left-or-right}: 0;
    }
  }
  ```

@include corner-icon("mail", top, left);

````
An example of a mixin with a interpolation.
## Extend/Inheritance
- You want to share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
```scss
.modal {
Â  position: fixed;
Â  top: 0;
Â  left: 0;
Â  width: 100%;
Â  height: 100%;
Â  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
}

.modal-red {
Â  @extend .modal;
Â  background-color: red;
}
````

## Placeholder classes

- This one is neat. It's a special type of class that only get compiled when it's extended.
- This means that if this class is declared but never extended, it won't show up in your css output.

```scss
%message-shared {
Â  border: 1px solid #ccc;
Â  padding: 10px;
Â  color: #333;
}

.success {
Â  @extend %message-shared;
Â  border-color: green;
}

// this won't show in the output because it was never extended.
%equal-heights {
Â  display: flex;
Â  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

## Comments

There are two ways to write comments in SCSS:

1. Single-line comments. These start with `//` and won't be included in the CSS output that's why they're called **silent comments**.

```scss
// This comment won't be included in the CSS.
```

2. Multi-line comments. These start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
   They're compiled into css comments and called **loud comments**.
   They're stripped from the output while in compressed mode.

```scss
/* But this comment will, except in compressed mode. */
```

If they're statements in this multi-line comment, they'll be evaluated before the compilation step.

```scss
/* It can also contain interpolation:
* 1 + 1 = #{1 + 1} */
```

## Variables

I don't think I need to define what a variable is ðŸ˜‚.
But CSS has variables, as well. Are those different than SCSS variables? Yes, they're totally different.
Let's see that comparison.

| Sass                                                                                                                     | CSS                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stripped away by sass (not included in the output)                                                                       | Included in the output as is                                                                           |
| hold one value at a time                                                                                                 | can have different values for different elements                                                       |
| They're **imperative** which means if a variable is used and then changed its value, the earlier use will stay the same. | They're **declarative** which means if you change the value, it'll affect both earlier and later uses. |

```scss
$variable: value 1;
.rule-1 {
  value: $variable; // this will be 1
}

$variable: value 2;
.rule-2 {
  value: $variable; // this will be 2
}
```

In SASS, both`$brand-color` and `$brand_color` refer to the same variable. This is done for historical reasons when only underscores were allowed.

### Default values

- Default values work in SCSS the same way they do in -say- JavaScript. If the value of that variable is not defined or is null, their default values kick in.
- It's normally valuable for library authors when they want to allow their users to override some of variables' values.
- Only variables defined at the top of sass module with `!default` flag can be configured.

```scss
// _library.scss
$black: #000 !default;
$border-radius: 0.25rem !default;
$box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default;

code {
  border-radius: $border-radius;
  box-shadow: $box-shadow;
}
```

You can override `$black`, `$border-radius` & `$box-shadow` in your file as follows.

```scss
// style.scss
@use 'library' with (
  $black: #222,
  $border-radius: 0.1rem
);
```

## Property declarations

### Nesting

1. In case of css properties that start with the same prefix, like `font-weight`, `font-style` and `font-family`.

```scss
.title {
Â  color: salmon;
Â  font: {
Â  Â  family: base.$font-stack;
Â  Â  style: italic;
Â  Â  weight: semibold;
Â  }
}
```

This also works with properties that have shorthand version.

```scss
.info-page {
  margin: auto {
    bottom: 10px;
    top: 8px;
  }
}
```

### Hidden Declarations

In case you want a property declaration to show up based on a condition. In scss, if a declaration's value is `null` or an empty unquoted string, this property won't compile to css.

```scss
$rounded-corners: false;

.button {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: if($rounded-corners, 5px, null);
}
```

## Couple of unrelated stuff

- Using interpolation with selectors.
  This could be helpful if have a dynamic selector that depends on user input or something like that.
  ```scss
  @mixin define-emoji($name, $glyph) {
    span.emoji-#{$name} {
      font-family: IconFont;
      font-variant: normal;
      font-weight: normal;
      content: $glyph;
    }
  }
  ```

@include define-emoji("women-holding-hands", "ðŸ‘­");

```
As you can see here, the selector name has become `span.emoji-women-holding-hands`.
***Pretty cool.***
## Things I might know but want to say out loud
- *Nesting* is here so that you **stop repeating** the same selectors over and over again.
